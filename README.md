# CLI Generators

This is a personal set of Command Line Interface (CLI) apps that help my development workflow/s. 

The purpose for creating these are:

  - Learn more about the programming languages that I'm writing the CLI's with, and the inner workings of how the libraries and middleware work with the projects they are being written for.
  - Cut down on the amount of time that is spent on repeating tasks therefore, making my development workflow more "[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)" (Don't Repeat Yourself), or perhaps "AHA" (Avoid Hasty Abstractions).

  The first CLI generator is built with Ruby and is to help me generate simple frontend applications.
  The CLI prompts you to answer a series of questions to choose and generate and populate (file content) common options that come with setting up a frontend application using technology options such as (and not limited to):

  1. Project Name and directory.
  2. The project manager that you would like to use; ie. (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun).
  3. The scripting language that you would like to use; ie. (EcmaScript/TypeScript).
  4. The style language to use; ie. (css/scss/sass).
